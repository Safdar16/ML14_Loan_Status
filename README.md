# ML14_Loan_Status
As the name suggests, the purpose of our project is to create and implement a machine learning algorithm that can predict whether or not a person will get a loan based on various factors like gender, salary, education, etc. 
TO accomplish this, we first implemented a logical regression model in python. With this model, we got a variable accuracy ranging from 75% to 85%. This wasnt high enough and it was too variable.
This is why we decided to shift to a deep learning algorithm. We implemented ANN. After playing around a bit with the number of hidden layers, epochs, and activation functions, we managed to get our accuracy up to 97% to 98%. 
The dataset we used was small and had many limitations, but despite that, we managed to achieve what we did.
